## 🚀 Features
It uses Machine Learning concepts in a real-time computer vision system that automatically detects whether a person is wearing a helmet from images or live video streams. It uses deep learning techniques for accurate helmet and non-helmet classification, enabling automated safety monitoring without manual intervention. The system is efficient, works under varying lighting and environmental conditions, and can be integrated with CCTV or surveillance cameras, making it suitable for road safety enforcement and industrial safety applications.
